## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghuhn/langgraph-screener.git
cd langgraph-screener
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Build for production**
```bash
npm run build
```

## üîë API Configuration

The application uses Google's Gemini Pro API for AI processing. The API key is currently embedded for demo purposes, but for production use:

1. Create a `.env` file (not included in this template)
2. Add your Gemini API key: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
3. Update `src/utils/geminiApi.ts` to use the environment variable

## üìä Scoring Algorithm

The AI agents evaluate candidates across multiple dimensions:

- **Technical Skills** (0-100): Match with required technologies
- **Experience Level** (0-100): Relevant work experience assessment
- **Education** (0-100): Educational background alignment
- **Communication** (0-100): Writing style and presentation quality
- **Cultural Fit** (0-100): Alignment with company values and role

## üöÄ Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel and ready for production:

- **Live Demo**: [https://langgraph-screener.vercel.app](https://langgraph-screener.vercel.app)
- **Platform**: Vercel (automatic deployments from main branch)
- **Environment**: Set `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in Vercel dashboard
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`

### Testing the LangGraph Implementation
- **Test Interface**: Visit `/test-langgraph` to test the workflow
- **Sample Data**: Built-in test data for immediate validation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch agent progress and state updates

## üéØ LangGraph Implementation Details

### Current Features
- **Custom Workflow System**: LangGraph-inspired sequential processing
